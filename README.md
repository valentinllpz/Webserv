# Webserv

This [42](https://42.fr/en/homepage/) project's goal is to make us write our own HTTP/1.1 [web server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server) from scratch in C++. I worked on this project with [Jehanne Dussert](https://github.com/JehanneDussert/) and [Melchior Maj](https://github.com/mmaj0708/).

We needed to master [socket programming](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/socket-programming-cc/) to allow communication between our server and a client. Another important part of this project was to understand in depth what is the [HTTP protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTTP) and respect it whilst handling [requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods) and sending [responses](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/HTTP/Status), in order to let our server communicate with a modern browser. We based our configuration file syntax on a logic close to the one used by [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/).

## ‚ú® Features

### *Methods implemented*

Method|Behavior
-----|------
GET| Requests data from a specified resource
POST| Sends data to a server to create/update a resource
DELETE| Deletes the specified resource on the server


### *Technical choice*

The subject gave us the choice between those 4 functions to handle I/O sockets operations:

Function|Description|OS
-----|-----|-----
[select()](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/select.2.html) | allows a program to monitor multiple file descriptors, waiting until one or more of the file descriptors become "ready" for some class of I/O operation (e.g., input possible).  A file descriptor is considered ready if it is possible to perform a corresponding I/O operation (e.g., [read(2)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html), or a sufficiently small [write(2)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/write.2.html)) without blocking. |  MacOS & Linux
[poll()](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/poll.2.html)| performs a similar task to [select(2)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/select.2.html): it waits for one of a set of file descriptors to become ready to perform I/O.  The Linux-specific [epoll(7)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/epoll.7.html) API performs a similar task, but offers features beyond those found in poll(). | MacOS & Linux
[epoll()](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/epoll.7.html)| The epoll API performs a similar task to [poll(2)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/poll.2.html): monitoring multiple file descriptors to see if I/O is possible on any of them.  The epoll API can be used either as an edge-triggered or a level-triggered interface and scales well to large numbers of watched file descriptors.| Linux
[kqueue()](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=kqueue&sektion=2)| The kqueue() system call provides a generic method	of notifying the user when an event happens or a	condition holds, based on the results of small pieces of kernel code termed filters.  A kevent is	identified by the (ident, filter) pair; there may only be one unique	kevent per kqueue. | FreeBSD & Mac OS

After some researches, we have chosen to work with poll for the following reasons:
* works on both Linux and Mac OS
* more optimised and quicker than select
* easier to use than select
* a lot of documentation available

## üß≠ Usage

1. Clone this repo and access it with `cd`
2. Run `./build.sh` to build the project and automatically set the path in `example.conf`
3. Start the server with `./webserv example.conf`. Feel free to make your own configuration file!
