# Webserv

This [42](https://42.fr/en/homepage/) project's goal is to make us write our own web server from scratch in C++. We needed to master [socket programming](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/socket-programming-cc/) to allow communication between our server and a client. Another important part of this project was to understand in depth what is the [HTTP protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTTP) and respect it whilst handling [requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods) and sending [responses](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/HTTP/Status), in order to let our server communicate with a modern browser. We based our configuration file syntax on a logic close to the one used by [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/).

## How does it work

 1) The client asks the server to open a connexion to send one or several requests and receive answers. It can be a new connexion or an existing one that has been previously opened.
 2) The client sends a request to the server.
 3) The server sends an answer to the client.
 4) The connexion is closed or will be reused for future requests.

## Request & answer's structure

#### 1) HTTP request

The request contains:

* The HTTP method. For our project, only the GET, POST and DELETE methods will be coded.

Method|Behavior
-----|------
GET| Requests data from a specified resource (for instance if you want to get srcs/file.html ressource)
POST| Sends data to a server to create/update a resource
DELETE| Deletes the specified resource

* The path of the ressource

* The version of the HTTP protocol (it will be HTTP/1.1 for our project)

* Optional headers : languages, host, cache-control...

* A body that will contain the ressource sent

![Alt text](/docs/request.png?raw=true "Request example")

#### 2) HTTP response

The response contains:

* The version of the HTTP protocol

* The status code. It will indicate whether the request was successful or not

* The status message. It is a short description of the status code's meaning

* The HTTP headers

* A body (optional) containing the fetched resource

# Technical choice

Function|Description & OS
-----|------
select| there are as many waiting lists as there are sockets. Works on Linux & MacOS
poll| the socket itself has its own waiting list. The socket has to be added and deleted only once (=/= select). Works on MacOS
epoll| the socket itself has its own waiting list. The socket has to be added and deleted only once (=/= select). Works on Linux
kqueue| we didn't find a lot of documentation about kqueue. Works on FreeBSD

For our project, we have chosen to work on MacOS and to use poll because it seemed:
* more optimised and quicker
* easier to use
* provided with documentation

You really should read [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17355593/why-is-epoll-faster-than-select/17355702) if you want to better understand our choice.

# Socket programming

```
Socket programming is a way of connecting two nodes on a network to communicate with each other. 
One socket(node) listens on a particular port at an IP, while other socket reaches out 
to the other to form a connection.
```

üñá [Reference](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/socket-programming-cc/)

Here, you will learn how to create:
* your server socket
* your client socket
* how to make them communicate

## Server socket

First of all, you have to include
:
`````
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
`````

Then, you have to complete the following steps:

#### 1) Socket creation

````
int sockfd = socket(int domain, int type, int protocol);
`````

It will create a socket descriptor (sockfd) that will be a communication point.

Variable|Type|Description
-----|------|------
domain| int | Communication domain
type| int | Communication type
protocol| int | Protocol value (for IP -> 0)

Return value:
* a descriptor referencing the socket
* -1 if an error occurs

#### 2) Setsockopt (optional)

````
int setsockopt(int sockfd, int level, int optname, const void *optval, socklen_t optlen);
````

Helps in reuse of address and port. Prevents error such as: ‚Äúaddress already in use‚Äù.

Variable|Type|Description
-----|------|------
sockfd| int | The socket descriptor created
level| int | Protocol level
optname| int | Option to set
optval| const void * | Identifies a buffer in which the value for the requested option is to be returned
optlen| socklen_t | The size of the optval buffer

Return value:
* 0 if it's a success
* -1 if an error occurs

#### 3) Bind

````
int bind(int sockfd, const struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t addrlen);
````

It will give a name to the socket previously created.

Variable|Type|Description
-----|------|------
sockfd| int | The socket descriptor created
addr| const struct sockaddr * | Cast the structure pointer passed in addr in order to avoid compiler warnings
addrlen| socklen_t | The size in bytes of the address structure addr

Return value:
* 0 if it's a success
* -1 if an error occurs

#### 4) Listen

````
int listen(int sockfd, int backlog);
````

Waiting for a connexion on the socket.

Variable|Type|Description
-----|------|------
sockfd| int | The socket descriptor created
backlog| int | The maximum number of outstanding connections in the socket's listen queue

Return value:
* 0 if it's a success
* -1 if an error occurs

#### 5) Accept

````
int new_socket = accept(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t *addrlen);
````

Accept a connexion on a socket.

Variable|Type|Description
-----|------|------
sockfd| int | The socket descriptor created
addr| struct sockaddr * | Cast the structure pointer passed in addr in order to avoid compiler warnings
addrlen| socklen_t | The size in bytes of the address structure addr

Return value:
* a file descriptor for the accepted socket (= non-negative integer)
* -1 if an error occurs

## Client socket

#### 1) Create the client socket

#### 2) Connect the client socket to the server

#### 3) Send the response
